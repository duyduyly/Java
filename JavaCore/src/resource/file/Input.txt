Write a paragraph about your daily routine - mẫu 1
My daily routine typically begins with an early morning wake-up,

followed by a quick workout to energize myself for the day ahead.

After that, I enjoy a nutritious breakfast and a hot cup of coffee

 to kick-start my morning. Then, I dive into my work, which usually involves checking and responding to emails, attending meetings, and completing tasks. During my lunch break, I take a moment to relax and recharge before diving back into work. In the evening, I make it a point to unwind by going for a walk, reading a book, or spending time with family and friends. Finally, I wind down with a relaxing evening routine before heading to bed, ready to start the cycle all over again the next day.

Every morning from Monday to Saturday, I get up at 6 o'clock. After breakfast, I go to school by bicycle. It takes me about 20 minutes from my house to my school. Usually, I study at school until 11:30 a.m. I return home at noon to have lunch with my family. In the afternoon I attend English and computer courses. I always get home just in time for dinner at 7:30 p.m. After dinner, while my parents are watching television in the living room, I read books or prepare for school in my own room.
